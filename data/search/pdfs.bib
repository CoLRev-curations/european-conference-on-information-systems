The panel will address the link between ICT and global work from various viewpoints: Talent Management: As ICT has made the accessing and deployment of talent from all over the globe possible, what are some of the strategies that firms can employ to insure that they are effectively recruiting, developing and managing global talent? How are companies dealing with the salary disparities that arise when employing workers from different locations on the same project? How can centers of excellence deliver expertise from remote locations to solve local problems? Cross-Cultural Management: Organizations increasingly rely on global virtual teams to accomplish a range of activities, from ongoing operations to project-specific work. What progress has been made in addressing problems of ICT and culture? What best practices do businesses use, not only to overcome problems, but also to leverage distributed structures? Technology Transfer: Increasingly, as organizations reach out for talent and markets in countries other than their home country, the challenge of integrating insights from off shore partners to create new products and markets becomes more difficult. Is technology transfer one-way or two-way? How do firms avoid "headquarters syndrome"? Sourcing Management: Firms often distribute their software development projects globally and make their sourcing decisions with the main focus on cost reduction. Aspects like interaction effects among projects, and sites which affect the costs and the risks of a sourcing portfolio are currently inadequately considered or even neglected, what often results in flawed sourcing decisions. Which aspects should be considered against this backdrop to valuate different sourcing alternatives? What kind of interaction effects are relevant in making sourcing decisions and how can they be considered?},
